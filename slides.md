# What is a Git branch?

- 🖖 Branches allow developers to **diverge** from the main branch by creating
separate branches to isolate code changes
- 👉 A branch is essentially a reference or a **pointer** to the latest commit in
a given context; it’s not a container for commits.
- 🪶 The Git branching model is **lightweight** compared to other version control systems.
- ⛓️ Branches allow for **independent** lines of code that branch off the master branch, allowing developers to work independently before merging their changes back to the code base.

# What is a Git branching strategy?

Branching strategies help to

- 🧠 Enhance productivity by ensuring proper **coordination among developers**
- ⛓️ Enable **parallel development**
- 🏗️ Help organize a series of **planned, structured releases**
- 🛣️ Map a clear **path** when making changes to software through to production
- 🐛 Maintain a **bug-free** code where developers can quickly fix issues and get these changes back to production without disrupting the development workflow

# GitFlow

Created by Vincent Driessen:[^1]

<v-click>

There are 2 immortal branches:

</v-click>

<v-clicks>

- `master` branch is always production-ready.
- `develop` always has the latest delivered dev changes.

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

There are 3 types of supporting branches:

</v-click>

<v-clicks>

- **feature** — both branched off and merged back into `develop`; typically only exist on localhost, not in the remote.
- **hotfixes** — branched off `master` and merged back into both `developer` and `master`
- **releases** — branched off `develop` and merged back into both `developer` and `master`

</v-clicks>

<div v-click>

When `develop` basically resembles a new release, that's when the release branch
is created.

# Downsides of GitFlow

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

A note from Gitflow's creator: 
<blockquote class="mx-auto w-5/6">
Web apps are typically continuously delivered, not rolled back, and you don't 
have to support multiple versions of the software running in the wild...

If your team is doing continuous delivery of software, I would suggest to adopt 
a much simpler workflow (like GitHub flow) instead of trying to shoehorn git-flow
into your team...

If, however, you are building software that is explicitly versioned, or if you 
need to support multiple versions of your software in the wild, then git-flow 
may still be as good of a fit to your team as it has been to people in the last
10 years.

# If not GitFlow, then what?

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

<v-click>

Constant, continuous feedback is ideal.
We can't afford to wait too long to check if my changes work with yours.

</v-click>

<v-click>

Branches, by definition, are designed to isolate and hide change.
Continuous integration, by definition, is designed to expose change.

</v-click>

<v-click>

GitHub Flow[^1] (aka plain old _feature branching_) is a good alternative.

</v-click>

<v-click>

Farley encourages developers to merge directly into trunk, but that seems to
subvert the Pull Request reviewing process. PRs are also useful for squashing
commits and keeping trunk history tidy.

# What about marketing releases?

<v-click>

Long-lived branches are eschewed.

Commits are flying into main branch.

A robust testing suite inspires confidence.

</v-click>

<v-click>

But what about work done towards a marketing release with a special launch date?

What if a new feature isn't supposed to be enabled until the New Year, for example?
